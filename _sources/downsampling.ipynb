    "# Downsampling\n",
    "\n",
    "When an interactive table is displayed by `itables`, the table data is embedded in the notebook output. As we don't want your notebook to become super heavy just because you displayed a large table, we have a downsampling mechanism in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data in a table is larger than `maxBytes`, which is equal to 64KB by default, `itables` will display only a subset of the table - one that fits into `maxBytes`, and display a warning that points to the `itables` documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish, you can increase the value of `maxBytes` or even deactivate the limit (with `maxBytes=0`). Similarly you can set a limit on the number of rows (`maxRows`, defaults to 0) or columns (`maxColumns`, defaults to `pd.get_option('display.max_columns')`)."
